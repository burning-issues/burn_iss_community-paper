We seek to do this from a community perspective and solicit researchers to share their viewpoints.\n\n\nOur initial survey\nWe have got responses from more than 60 wildfire scientists to the following questions:\n\nIn your opinion, which are 2 of the most pressing questions that need to be addressed to further our understanding of wildfire impacts on biogeochemical cycling in watersheds.\nWhat are the most important pathways towards better integrating fire science across scientific disciplines?\nWhat are the key roadblocks towards a more holistic understanding of the cumulative spatiotemporal impacts of wildfires in terrestrial and aquatic environments across both short and long timescales?"
