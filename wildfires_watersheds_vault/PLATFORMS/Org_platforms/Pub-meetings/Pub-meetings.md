## Checking in

## On the Fly Agenda
* Revisiting the analyses
* Scope of the paper
## Notes
There is some similarity between the word network and the conceptual diagram created by [[Allison Myers-Pigg]]. We need to include the human element or inspection. 

Text analysis will be part of the approach:
* There is bias in selecting the groups-Focus groups approach. Pros: more diversity information, we did reach groups that were different. 
* Potentially four working groups: 
	* UMD
	* Fires and Human Health-UW
	* The Future of Fire Consortium
	* Cathelijne Stoof group-Pyrogeography
Next steps:
* Where are we right now-Update to people previously engaged. Show progress with the initial analysis and identify next steps.

## Checking in
Participating on AGU and ATR
ATRs can be approved or denied. It's important to have a really strong justification. 

## On the Fly Agenda
Text analysis: basic word cloud, links and connections. 
Perhaps the papers for text analysis as well. 

## Notes
We need to figure out a forum to  share the results. 
Incorporate workload in the authorship order.
How to communicate this asks to the consortium. The paper would take a review tone.
We at PNNL could do the literature analysis part. 

Activities:

Word Exploratory Analysis (July 21)
Share the exploratory analysis and ask are you still interested? (By August 5th)
Work on finalizing the proposal (Week of Aug 12th)
Figuring out next steps (By the end of August)
Sharing the plans and next steps (Mid September)

## Tasks
- [x] Get wordclouds for surveys ‚úÖ 2022-08-05
- [x] Advance text analysis for surveys ‚úÖ 2022-08-05

## On the Fly Agenda
* Onboarding with the community review paper and decide our plan ahead. 
* Walk through the documentation and asks questions along. 
## Notes
* We [[Allison Myers-Pigg]] and other collaborators from [[PNNL]] to form a committee (Check notes in the docs, e.g., [[Tim Scheibe]], [[Alan Roebuck]], [[Morgan Barnes]]) came up with a survey to gather opinions about major topics related to fires. (Human health did not emerge as a topic).
* We tried to move from Teams to google drive to have more shareability. Demographic information cannot be used and should not be needed. 
* [[Allison Myers-Pigg]] have notes about the kind of demographic info we can or cannot use. 
* Analysis of the data has been mostly qualitative and could be influenced by bias and subjectivity. 
* Link with the last recollection of raw data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zBiKqmZ77hZ7poX3t6ljchQQ3nNOHESh
* Actual survey: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Acbh8W3p-oMSVriPmxJFY6uT2wNv6-vcPOCnM3zyCI/edit#gid=1546728807](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Acbh8W3p-oMSVriPmxJFY6uT2wNv6-vcPOCnM3zyCI/edit#gid=1546728807 "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11acbh8w3p-omsvripmxjfy6ut2wnv6-vcpocnm3zyci/edit#gid=1546728807")

* Desired product: A central figure with the burning questions, and breaking the sections. "A call to arms"
